# Web-development is a personal website an extensive biography that links all of my work past and present within it. After taking off from coding I am currently coming back to it in order to build my portfolio and commits in github to show potential employers that I have been busy coding. I am taking a Udemy course called "The complete web development bootcamp. I have a certificate in coding as I have completed my 250 hours at the University of Central Florida, but I want to go back and refresh my memory from the basics from building a website from the ground up starting with HTML (Hyper text Markup Language) the basics of web design.  As the website develops it will get more coprehensive and interactive. This will also give me a chance as mentioned to build up my commits in  Github to show how much work I have done as of late. 
## Back to basicsis allowing me to start with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, and enventually on to Python and beyond. If i were to apply for a job right now I would not be able to speak the language, but I feel that going back and refreshing my memory from the foundation will give me a more in depth knowledge and confidence to apply for work knowing I would be able to impress potential employers.
